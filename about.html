<h2>About This Project</h2>
<p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:#4b5d67;">
    <b>Human Activity Recognition (HAR)</b> is a computer vision project that leverages the power of deep learning and the YOLOv8 model to detect and classify various human activities from images. <br><br>
    <b>Key Features:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>State-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detection for accurate activity recognition</li>
        <li>Easy-to-use web interface for uploading images and viewing results</li>
        <li>Applications in security, healthcare, sports, and smart environments</li>
    </ul>
    <b>How it works:</b> Upload an image, and the model will highlight detected humans and label their activities, providing instant visual feedback.
